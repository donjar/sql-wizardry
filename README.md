# sql-wizardry
File for my SQL Queries Wizardry presentation

## Instructions
- The `dump.sql` file is the SQL dump file generated by `pg_dump`. To import them, run, for example: `cat dump.sql | sudo -u postgres psql`
- The Ruby files generate the insert statements. Code quality sort of sucks, I'm sorry. To import them to your database, run, for example: `ruby contest_scores_generator.rb | sudo -u postgres psql`
- The SQL files contain the queries as referenced in the presentation. To run them, type, for example: `cat contest_pivot_table.sql | sudo -u postgres psql`
